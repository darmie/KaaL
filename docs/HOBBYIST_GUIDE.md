# KaaL Hobbyist Guide: Build Your OS in Hours, Not Years

## Welcome!

You're about to build your own operating system using a clean-room native Rust microkernel. No PhD required!

## What Makes KaaL Special?

- **Native Rust Microkernel**: Built from scratch in pure Rust for ARM64
- **Fast to Start**: Get a working kernel in minutes
- **Simple & Clean**: Capability-based security without complexity
- **Composable**: Build your OS incrementally, component by component
- **MIT Licensed**: Use it however you want

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Prerequisites

You only need two things:

```bash
# 1. Install Rust nightly
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default nightly
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none

# 2. Install QEMU (for testing)
# macOS:
brew install qemu

# Linux:
sudo apt install qemu-system-aarch64
```

### 2. Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darmie/kaal.git
cd kaal

# Build the kernel
./build.sh --platform qemu-virt

# Run in QEMU
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a53 -m 128M -nographic \
  -kernel runtime/elfloader/target/aarch64-unknown-none-elf/release/elfloader
```

**You'll see:**

KaaL is a **microkernel**, which means:
- The kernel is small (core mechanisms only)
- Most OS services run in userspace
- Everything communicates via IPC
- Components are isolated for security

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Native Rust Microkernel

Unlike other teaching OS projects, KaaL is:
- **Clean-room implementation**: Written from scratch in Rust
- **No C dependencies**: 100% Rust, no legacy code
- **ARM64-native**: Targets modern 64-bit ARM processors
- **Capability-based**: Fine-grained access control built-in

#### 2. Composable Components

Build your OS by composing isolated components:

```rust
// Each component is an isolated program
Component {
    name: "filesystem",
    entry_point: fs_main,
    memory: 512KB,
    capabilities: [ReadDisk, WriteCache],
}
```

Components:
- Run in their own address space
- Have minimal privileges (only what they need)
- Communicate via IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
- Can't crash other components

#### 3. Capabilities = Access Rights

Instead of "root can do anything", KaaL uses **capabilities**:
- A capability is a token that grants a specific right
- No capability = no access (even for "root")
- Capabilities can't be forged or stolen
- Fine-grained: access specific memory, not all memory

Example:
```rust
// Component can ONLY write to serial port
capabilities: [
    SerialWrite(port: 0),  // Can write to serial0
    // No SerialRead - can't read
    // No DiskAccess - can't touch disk
]
```

## Building Your First Component

### Step 1: Write the Component

Create `my-component/src/main.rs`:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

// Your component's entry point
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    // Your code here!
    let message = "Hello from my component!\n";

    // Make a syscall to print
    unsafe {
        syscall::print(message);
    }

    // Component loop
    loop {
        // Wait for events
        syscall::wait();
    }
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Component

Create `my-component/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-component"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Add KaaL runtime dependencies here

[profile.release]
panic = "abort"
lto = true
opt-level = "z"
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Build System

Add to `build-config.toml`:

```toml
[[components]]
name = "my-component"
path = "components/my-component"
```

### Step 4: Build and Test

```bash
./build.sh --platform qemu-virt
# Your component will be included in the boot image
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
# Edit kernel code
cd kernel
vim src/my_feature.rs

# Build and test
./build.sh --platform qemu-virt

# Run in QEMU
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a53 -m 128M -nographic \
  -kernel runtime/elfloader/target/aarch64-unknown-none-elf/release/elfloader

# Exit with Ctrl-A then X
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start QEMU with GDB stub
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a53 -m 128M -nographic \
  -kernel runtime/elfloader/target/aarch64-unknown-none-elf/release/elfloader \
  -s -S

# Terminal 2: Connect debugger
lldb runtime/elfloader/target/aarch64-unknown-none-elf/release/elfloader
(lldb) gdb-remote localhost:1234
(lldb) breakpoint set --name _start
(lldb) continue
```

### Clean Builds

```bash
# Clean everything
./build.sh --clean

# Or just kernel
cd kernel && cargo clean
```

## Current Status (Chapter 7 Complete)

KaaL is under active development. Here's what works today:

### ‚úÖ Implemented (Ready to Use)

- **Chapter 1**: Bare metal boot, UART output, device tree parsing
- **Chapter 2**: Frame allocator, MMU setup, kernel page tables
- **Chapter 3**: Exception vectors, syscall interface, trap handling
- **Chapter 7**: Root task creation, EL0 transition, userspace execution

**This means you can:**
- Boot the kernel
- Run code in userspace
- Make syscalls
- Allocate memory
- Handle exceptions

### üöß In Progress

- **Chapter 4**: Thread Control Blocks (TCBs)
- **Chapter 5**: IPC endpoints and message passing
- **Chapter 6**: Capability space management

### üìù Planned

- **Chapter 8**: Interrupt handling
- **Chapter 9**: Virtual memory management
- **Chapter 10**: Device management
- **Chapter 11**: Scheduling
- **Chapter 12**: Advanced features

- **Microkernel Design**: "The seL4 Whitepaper" (for concepts, not code)
- **Rust Embedded**: The Embedded Rust Book
- **OS Development**: OSDev Wiki

## Common Questions

### "Why ARM64 instead of x86?"

- **Simpler**: ARM64 has cleaner exception handling and memory management
- **Modern**: Most new hardware is ARM (phones, tablets, servers, laptops)
- **Native Development**: If you have Apple Silicon, you're already on ARM64!
- **Future-proof**: ARM is the future of computing

### "Can I run this on real hardware?"

Yes! KaaL is designed for real ARM64 hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (work in progress)
- Other ARM64 boards (planned)
- Currently, QEMU is the easiest way to develop

### "Do I need to know seL4?"

No! KaaL is a **clean-room implementation** - not based on seL4 code.

While KaaL takes inspiration from seL4's security model (capabilities, isolation), you don't need to know anything about seL4 to use KaaL.

### "Is this a toy or production-ready?"

Currently: **Learning/hobby project** (Chapter 7 of 12)

Future goal: **Production-capable** microkernel for embedded and IoT

Right now, it's perfect for:
- Learning OS development
- Experimenting with microkernels
- Understanding ARM64 architecture
- Building hobby operating systems

### "How can I contribute?"

1. **Try it out**: Build and run the kernel
2. **Report issues**: Found a bug? Open an issue!
3. **Write docs**: Help improve guides and documentation
4. **Implement features**: Pick a chapter and start coding
5. **Share feedback**: What's confusing? What's great?

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**"aarch64-unknown-none target not found"**
```bash
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none
```

**"nightly required"**
```bash
rustup default nightly
```

**"linker error"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the kaal directory
./build.sh --clean
./build.sh --platform qemu-virt
```

### Runtime Issues

**QEMU hangs with no output**
- Make sure you're using `-nographic` flag
- Try adding `-serial mon:stdio` for more debug output
- Press `Ctrl-A` then `X` to force exit

**"No output after kernel loads"**
- Check that root task binary was built
- Look for error messages in elfloader output
- Try running with `-d int,guest_errors` for QEMU debug logs

### Getting Help

- **Check docs**: Most questions are answered in documentation
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or ask questions
- **Read code**: The kernel is small enough to understand fully
- **Experiment**: Try changing things and see what happens!

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **You've built and run KaaL** - Great start!
2. üìñ **Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Understand the design
3. üîç **Explore the code** - Start with `kernel/src/main.rs`
4. üöÄ **Implement a feature** - Pick a chapter from [MICROKERNEL_CHAPTERS.md](MICROKERNEL_CHAPTERS.md)
5. ü§ù **Join development** - Contribute to the project!

You don't need:
- Complex toolchains
- Gigabytes of dependencies
- Years of experience
- A CS degree

You just need:
- Curiosity about how computers work
