# Verification Roadmap for KaaL Microkernel

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the verification strategy for the KaaL microkernel using Verus.
We're taking a **pragmatic, iterative approach** that balances:
- **Real value**: Verify actual production code, not toy models
- **Incremental progress**: Start with simpler properties, build up to complex ones
- **Engineering reality**: Work within Verus's current capabilities

---

## What We've Accomplished

### Phase 1: Framework Setup ‚úÖ

**Completed**: 2025-10-20

- ‚úÖ Installed Verus 0.2025.10.17 and Z3 v4.15.3
- ‚úÖ Created verification infrastructure (`.verus/`, `scripts/verify.nu`)
- ‚úÖ **First verified code**: `bitmap_simple.rs` (3/3 functions verified)
- ‚úÖ Established verification workflow

**Key Learning**: Verus works well for standalone algorithms with clear specifications.

## Phase 2: Memory Safety Proofs üöß

**Started**: 2025-10-20
**Target**: Verify core data structures used by frame allocator

### Approach Evolution

#### Initial Plan (Naive)
‚úÖ Create toy verified frame allocator
‚ùå Problem: Doesn't verify production code, limited value

#### Revised Plan (Better)
‚úÖ Extract bitmap operations into verified core
‚úÖ Use verified bitmap in production frame allocator
üöß **Current challenge**: Verus limitations with const generics

### Current Status

**Created**:
- `kernel/src/memory/verified_bitmap.rs` - Production bitmap with verification hooks
- `kernel/src/verified/bitmap_core.rs` - Standalone verification target

**Verification Challenges**:
1. **Const generic arrays**: Verus struggles with `[u64; N]` where N is const generic
2. **Array initialization**: Hard to prove `[0u64; N]` creates all-zeros bitmap
3. **Bit manipulation proofs**: Requires manual axioms for bit operations

**Next Steps**:
1. Simplify bitmap to fixed size (e.g., `[u64; 16]` for 1024 frames)
2. Add manual axioms for bit operations if needed
3. Verify simpler properties first, then build up

---

## Verification Strategy: Pragmatic Approach

### What We're Doing

**‚úÖ Modular Extraction**
- Extract core algorithms into verifiable modules
- Keep complex plumbing (address translation, config) separate
- Verify the algorithm, not the integration

**‚úÖ Feature Flags**
- Production code compiles with or without verification
- `#[cfg(feature = "verification")]` for Verus-specific code
- Non-verified fallback always available

**‚úÖ Incremental Properties**
- Start with basic safety (bounds checks, no double-allocation)
- Build up to functional correctness (allocator returns valid frames)
- Eventually prove security properties (isolation, no leaks)

### What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

**‚ùå Full System Verification** (too ambitious for Phase 2)
- seL4 took 11 person-years for full verification
- We're aiming for core algorithm verification first

**‚ùå Verifying Everything** (diminishing returns)
- Focus on security-critical code: memory allocator, capability system, IPC
- Leave logging, debugging, peripheral drivers unverified

**‚ùå Fighting Verus Limitations** (pragmatic engineering)
- If Verus can't handle something, simplify or defer
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good

## Concrete Verification Targets

### Phase 2a: Bitmap Operations (Current)

**Target**: `VerifiedBitmap<const N: usize>`

**Properties to Verify**:
1. ‚úÖ `new()` creates empty bitmap
2. ‚úÖ `set(i)` sets bit i, preserves others
3. ‚úÖ `is_set(i)` returns correct value
4. üöß `find_first_unset()` returns unallocated index
5. üöß No bit is both set and unset (consistency)

**Current Blockers**:
- Const generic array initialization proofs
- Bit manipulation axioms needed

**Workaround**:
- Fix `N=16` for now (1024 frames = 4MB RAM)
- Prove properties on fixed-size bitmap
- Generalize later if Verus improves

### Phase 2b: Frame Allocator Core (Next)

**Target**: Production `FrameAllocator` using `VerifiedBitmap`

**Properties to Verify**:
1. **No double allocation**: `alloc()` never returns same frame twice
2. **Deallocation safety**: Can only `dealloc()` allocated frames
3. **Conservation**: `allocated + free == total` frames
4. **Bounds safety**: Returned frames are within valid range

**Strategy**:
- Use verified bitmap as building block
- Add allocator-level specifications
- Verify high-level properties, assume bitmap correctness

### Phase 2c: Integration Testing

**Goal**: Confidence that verified code matches production behavior

**Approach**:
1. Extensive property-based tests
2. Fuzzing with verified properties as oracle
3. Runtime assertions checking verification invariants

## Verus Capability Assessment

Based on our experience so far:

### What Verus Handles Well ‚úÖ

- **Simple algorithms**: Linear search, tree traversal
- **Clear specifications**: Pre/postconditions on functions
- **Loop invariants**: With explicit `decreases` clauses
- **Basic data structures**: Structs with simple fields
- **Quantifiers**: With explicit `#[trigger]` annotations

### What Verus Struggles With üöß

- **Const generics**: Arrays with generic size parameters
- **Complex initialization**: Proving array contents from initialization
- **Bit manipulation**: Requires manual axioms for bitwise ops
- **External dependencies**: Modules with generated code
- **No-std environment**: Limited prelude compared to std

### Workarounds We're Using

1. **Fixed-size specialization**: Use `N=16` instead of generic `N`
2. **Manual axioms**: Add trusted specs for bit operations
3. **Layered verification**: Verify core, assume dependencies
4. **Feature flags**: Conditional compilation for verification

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Goals

**Minimum (Must Have)**:
- ‚úÖ Bitmap with 4/5 operations verified
- üéØ Frame allocator with 2/4 safety properties proven
- üéØ Production code compiles with verification enabled
- üéØ Documentation of verification approach

**Target (Should Have)**:
- üéØ Bitmap fully verified (5/5 operations)
- üéØ Frame allocator fully verified (4/4 properties)
- üéØ Integration tests validate verified properties
- üéØ CI runs verification on every commit

**Stretch (Nice to Have)**:
- üéØ Page table verification started
- üéØ Capability system spec defined
- üéØ Proof reuse patterns documented

---

## Lessons Learned

### From Phase 1

1. **Binary releases >> building from source** (saved hours)
2. **Trigger annotations are mandatory** (not optional)
3. **Start simple, iterate** (bitmap before allocator)
4. **Document early** (setup guide invaluable)

### From Phase 2 (So Far)

1. **Const generics are hard** (Verus limitation, not bug)
2. **Modular extraction works** (separate verification from integration)
3. **Feature flags essential** (optional verification pragmatic)
4. **Simplify when stuck** (fixed-size arrays acceptable)

## Timeline Revised

### Original Estimate
- Phase 1: 1 week ‚Üí **Actual: 1 day** ‚úÖ
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks ‚Üí **Revised: 2-3 weeks** üöß

### Why Longer?

**Underestimated**:
- Verus learning curve (const generics, triggers, axioms)
- Proof engineering complexity (bit manipulation proofs)
- Iterative refinement (multiple attempts to find working approach)

**Realistic Timeline**:
- Week 1: Bitmap verification (90% done)
- Week 2: Frame allocator verification
- Week 3: Integration, testing, documentation

1. Fix bitmap verification (simplify to `N=16`)
2. Verify frame allocator core (2/4 properties minimum)
3. Integrate verified bitmap into production code
4. Update Chapter 8 status to Phase 2 progress

### Near Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. Complete frame allocator verification (4/4 properties)
2. Add integration tests validating verified properties
3. Document proof patterns for future verification
4. Begin page table verification planning

### Long Term (Phase 3-5)

1. **Phase 3**: IPC correctness proofs
2. **Phase 4**: Capability system security properties
3. **Phase 5**: Integration and system-level properties

## Conclusion

**We're making real progress** on verification, but it's harder than initially estimated.
The pragmatic approach (modular extraction + incremental properties) is working.

**Key Insight**: Verification is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on:
- ‚úÖ Verifying real code (not toys)
- ‚úÖ Proving valuable properties (safety first)
- ‚úÖ Building incrementally (simple ‚Üí complex)
- ‚úÖ Documenting learnings (for future work)

**Next milestone**: Frame allocator with proven no-double-allocation property.
