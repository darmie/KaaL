### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darmie/KaaL.git
cd KaaL

# Run automated setup
nu setup.nu

# Verify installation
nu setup.nu --verify-only
```

## üìã Planning Documents

### Internal Documentation (in `.claude/`)
These are internal development artifacts, not public chapters:
- `CHAPTER_XX_STATUS.md` - Development status tracking
- Session summaries and debug notes
- Project planning documents

### Public Educational Content (in `docs/chapters/`)
These are or will become public educational resources:
- `XX-chapter-name.md` - Educational chapters
- `EDUCATIONAL_CHAPTERS_PLAN.md` - Master plan (this roadmap)
- Implementation plans and overviews

## üéì Teaching Philosophy

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with minimal working examples
- Add features incrementally
- Explain the "why" before the "how"
- Build intuition before formalism

### Theory + Practice
- Theoretical foundations explained clearly
- Hands-on implementation for every concept
- Real hardware testing (QEMU + Raspberry Pi)
- Formal verification where applicable

### Multiple Perspectives
- **Academic**: Formal semantics and proofs
- **Practical**: Working code and trade-offs
- **Historical**: Why designs evolved this way
- **Comparative**: How other kernels do it

### Self-Contained Modules
- Each chapter stands alone when possible
- Clear prerequisites stated upfront
- No assumed knowledge beyond prerequisites
- References to background material

## üöÄ Contributing
