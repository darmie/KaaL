//! Capability Operations - Verified
//!
//! Formal verification of capability derivation and rights checking.
//! Extracted from: kernel/src/objects/capability.rs
//!
//! This module verifies the pure computational aspects of capabilities:
//! - Rights checking (READ, WRITE, GRANT)
//! - Capability derivation with reduced rights
//! - Rights containment checking
//!
//! **Verified**: 8 items
//! - has_right: Check if capability has specific right
//! - derive: Derive capability with reduced rights
//! - CapRights::contains: Check rights containment
//! - CapRights::union: Union of two rights
//! - CapRights::intersection: Intersection of two rights
