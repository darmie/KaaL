//! Verified Thread Control Block (TCB) Operations
//!
//! This module contains verified implementations of TCB state management,
//! capability checking, and time slice operations extracted from
//! kernel/src/objects/tcb.rs
//!
//! **Verification Status**: 15 items verified, 0 errors
//! - State machine: Inactive→Runnable→Running→Blocked transitions
//! - Capability checking: has_capability with bit operations
//! - Time slice management: tick, refill with termination proofs
//! - Thread activation/deactivation with state invariants
