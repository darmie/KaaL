//! IRQ Handler and IRQ Control Objects
//!
//! This module implements the IRQ capability system for delegating hardware interrupts
//! to userspace device drivers.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! KaaL follows seL4's IRQ model:
//!
//! ### IRQControl
//! - Global singleton capability (only root-task has it)
//! - Allows allocation of IRQHandler capabilities
//! - One IRQControl per system
//!
//! ### IRQHandler
//! - Per-IRQ capability
//! - Binds a specific IRQ to a notification object
//! - When IRQ fires, kernel signals the notification
//! - Userspace driver waits on notification to receive IRQ
//!
//! ## IRQ Handling Flow
//!
//! 1. Root-task has IRQControl capability
//! 2. Driver requests IRQ: `IRQControl_Get(irq_control, irq_num, notif, irq_handler_slot)`
//! 3. Kernel creates IRQHandler, binds IRQ â†’ notification
//! 4. Driver calls `sys_wait(notification)` to wait for IRQs
//! 5. When IRQ fires:
//!    - Kernel ACKs interrupt at GIC
//!    - Kernel signals notification
//!    - Userspace driver wakes up
//!    - Driver services the device
//!    - Driver calls `IRQHandler_Ack(irq_handler)` to re-enable IRQ
//!
//! ## Differences from seL4
//!
//! seL4 requires explicit IRQ acknowledgment from userspace before the IRQ
//! can fire again. KaaL follows the same model for safety:
//! - Prevents IRQ storms
//! - Forces driver to handle interrupt before enabling next one
//! - Provides backpressure if driver is slow

/// IRQ Handler - capability for receiving hardware interrupts
///
/// An IRQHandler binds a specific hardware IRQ to a notification object.
/// When the IRQ fires, the kernel signals the notification, waking up
/// the waiting userspace driver.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. Created by IRQControl_Get syscall
/// 2. Binds IRQ number to notification
/// 3. IRQ is disabled until first Ack
/// 4. On IRQ: kernel signals notification
/// 5. Driver services device
/// 6. Driver calls IRQHandler_Ack to re-enable
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// - Only one IRQHandler per IRQ number (enforced by IRQ_HANDLERS table)
/// - IRQ is masked until driver acknowledges
/// - Prevents IRQ storms and race conditions
